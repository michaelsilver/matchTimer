FIRST FRC Match Timer

This match timer is intended for use at competitions. By inputting your match schedule, you will always know how much time you have
before your next match. When you first download, you probably want to change the team-related globals to match your team. That would 
be your team number and colors. You also may want to adjust CYCLETIME if your performance is slow - this is the time inbetween timer 
updates.

Please feel free to play and let me know if you have any updates to pull. Hope this helps your team too.
