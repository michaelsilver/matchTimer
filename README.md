FIRST FRC Match Timer

This match timer is intended for use at competitions. By inputting your match 
schedule, you will always know how much time you have before your next match. 
When you first download, you probably want to change the team-related globals 
to match your team. That would be your team number and colors. You also may 
want to adjust CYCLETIME if your performance is poor - this is the time in 
between timer updates.

Due to competitions only being Wednesdays through Sundays and for ease of 
adding new matches, those days of the week are the only ones allowed. To fiddle
with this on Mondays and Tuesdays, you may need to add functionality.

Please feel free to play and let me know if you have any updates to pull. I'm 
particularly interested in thoughts related to pulling data from the FRC API, 
though since most events do not have internet access, this may not be usable 
without a workaround.

Hope this helps your team as much as it helps ours.

Team 246
